> [!WARNING]
> In order to successfully use this application, you need to ensure IPv6 is enabled properly.
> In addition, the matter protocol is relying on mDNS and UDP. If you are using VLANs you need
> to make sure that UDP (especially mDNS) packages are routed properly.
>
> If you are facing issues, make sure to look at the [troubleshooting guide](../Guides/Connect%20Multiple%20Fabrics.md).

## 2. Manual Deployment

### 2.1 Docker Image

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure your docker installation has IPv6 enabled, too.
> See [this guide](https://fariszr.com/docker-ipv6-setup-with-propagation/) for more information.

This repository builds a docker image for every release. You can simply run it by using `docker-compose`:

```yaml
services:
  matter-hub:
    image: ghcr.io/zvikarp/ha-plus-matter-hub:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    environment: # more options can be found in the configuration section
      - HAMH_HOME_ASSISTANT_URL=http://192.168.178.123:8123/
      - HAMH_HOME_ASSISTANT_ACCESS_TOKEN=ey...ZI
      - HAMH_LOG_LEVEL=info
      - HAMH_HTTP_PORT=8482
    volumes:
      - $PWD/ha-plus-matter-hub:/data
```

Having that you can simply run `docker compose up -d` to start the container.

For the docker image, data is stored in `/data`, so you can mount a volume there for persistence.

Alternatively, you can also run the container as follows:

```bash
docker run -d \
  # more options can be found in the configuration section
  # required: the address of your home assistant instance
  -e HAMH_HOME_ASSISTANT_URL="http://192.168.178.123:8123/" \
  # required: a long lived access token for your home assistant instance
  -e HAMH_HOME_ASSISTANT_ACCESS_TOKEN="eyJ.....dlc" \
  # optional: debug | info | warn | error
  # default: info
  -e HAMH_LOG_LEVEL="info" \
  # optional: the port to use for the web ui
  # default: 8482
  -e HAMH_HTTP_PORT=8482 \
  # recommended: persist the configuration and application data
  -v $PWD/ha-plus-matter-hub:/data \
  # required due to restrictions in matter
  --network=host \
  ghcr.io/zvikarp/ha-plus-matter-hub:latest
```

See 2.3 for more configuration options.

Now you can go ahead and follow the [bridge configuration guide](./Bridge%20Configuration.md).

### 2.2 Manual installation using `npm`

If you want to install this application by hand, you simply need to run

```bash
npm install -g ha-plus-matter-hub
```

To start the application, run

```bash
ha-plus-matter-hub start \
  # required: the address of your home assistant instance
  # can be replaced with an environment variable: HAMH_HOME_ASSISTANT_URL
  --home-assistant-url="http://192.168.178.123:8123/" \
  # required: a long lived access token for your home assistant instance
  # can be replaced with an environment variable: HAMH_HOME_ASSISTANT_ACCESS_TOKEN
  --home-assistant-access-token="eyJ.....dlc" \
  # optional: debug | info | warn | error
  # default: info
  # can be replaced with an environment variable: HAMH_LOG_LEVEL
  --log-level=info \
  # optional: the port to use for the web ui
  # default: 8482
  # can be replaced with an environment variable: HAMH_WEB_PORT
  --http-port=8482
```

The application will store its data in `$HOME/.ha-plus-matter-hub`. You can configure the storage path by
using the `--storage-location=/path/to/storage` option or `HAMH_STORAGE_STORAGE` environment variable.

See 2.3 for more configuration options.

Now you can go ahead and follow the [bridge configuration guide](./Bridge%20Configuration.md).

Each of those configuration options can be configured via environment variables, too. Simply prefix them with `HAMH_`

**Those configuration options are not needed for the Home Assistant Addon Installation type.**
